# HNG-DevOps-1(Alpha Bot) Documentation

## Overview

In today's fast-paced development environment, efficient code review and deployment processes are paramount, optimizing processes workflow via automation is key. 
This custom **Alpha bot**, a Node.js application, automates the process of building, deploying and merging pull requests (PRs). It leverages **Docker** for containerization in isolated environments, exposing deployed URL via **Ngrok**, clean up of containers and resources and provides comprehensive feedback on the deployment via comments. It is repository agnostic.

## Architecture
![Bot Architechture](images/alpha-bot.png)
The application listens for pull request events (`opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, `closed`) and performs the following actions:
- **Opened/Reopened/Synchronize**: Triggers a deployment of the pull request code using Docker and adds a comment to the pull request.
- **Closed**: Removes the deployed Docker container and its associated resources, and adds a comment to the pull request

## Getting Started

### Section A: Alpha-Bot Usage
Alpha-Bot is Repository agnostic, it works on any and every respository it is set up for as far as it revolves around containerization of the code.
A few preresquities before running.
- A Github account
- The intended respository to be automated. Docker File  not present, Create [here](https://medium.com/@swalperen3008/what-is-dockerize-and-dockerize-your-project-a-step-by-step-guide-899c48a34df6#:~:text=When%20you%20%E2%80%9CDockerize%E2%80%9D%20an%20application,application%20as%20a%20Docker%20container.)

#### Step 1. Intergration with Intended Repository
- To install the Alpha-bot application, [Click here](https://github.com/apps/alphateam-hng-devops)
![Installation](images/realstepa)
- Next select the repository permissions it should have access to, it then reflects on the applications page
![permissions](images/realstepb)
![view](images/realstepc)


### Section B: Alpha-Bot Testing

### Section C: Alpha-Bot Local Development/SetUp
A local run through of developing the Alpha-Bot from scratch.
Prerequisites for the set up:
- A Github Account
- A Liunx Server preferably Ubuntu
- Basic Javascript Knowledge

#### Step 1. Create a Github App
- At the top right corner of the page, select the github profile photo, scroll down to **settings** and click
![settings](images/stepa)
- Scroll the next drop down and select **developer settings** then **Github Apps** and finally **New Github App**
- The Requirements form pop, fill as follow
![Requirements](stepd.png)
- For the webhook url,insert the url pointing to your ngrok URL or any public URL where the bot is running.
- Webhook secret,

#### Step 2. Set the permissions:
- Repository permissions: Read & write for Issues.
- Subscribe to events: Choose Pull requests.

#### Step 3. Installation of the GitHub App:
- Install the app on your desired repositories.
- Generate and Download Private Key:

Download the private key and save it in your project directory. Update the .env file with the path to this private key.

### Step 2. Clone Repository
On your local machine, clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-bot.git
```
```
cd github-bot
```
### Step 3. Install Dependencies
Its a nodejs app, npm package manager
```shell
npm install
```
```
node- --version
```
### Step 4: Code Blocks Explanation
-  `package.json` file manages the projects dependencies and scripts
- `index.js` sets up the Express server and defines the webhook endpoint
```js
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import 'dotenv/config';
import { addPRComment, verifySignature } from './services/repositoryService.js';
import { triggerDeployment, removeDeployedContainer } from './services/deploymentService.js';
```
- express: Framework for building web servers.
- body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- dotenv/config: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
- addPRComment, verifySignature: Functions from repositoryService.js.
- triggerDeployment, removeDeployedContainer: Functions from deploymentService.js.
Server Set Up
```js
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3003;
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```
- app: Creates an Express application.
- port: Port on which the server will listen.
- app.use(bodyParser.json()): Middleware to parse JSON request bodies.
Webhook Endpoint
```js
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
    const signature = req.headers['x-hub-signature'];
    console.log(signature);

    if (!verifySignature(payload, signature)) {
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid signature');
    }

    const event = req.headers['x-github-event'];
    console.log(event);
    if (event === 'pull_request') {
        const action = req.body.action;
        console.log(action);
        const prNumber = req.body.number;
        const branchName = req.body.pull_request.head.ref;
        const repoName = req.body.repository.full_name;
        const repoUrl = `https://github.com/${repoName}.git`;
        const repoBranchName = `${repoName.replace('/', '_')}_${branchName.replace('/', '_')}`;
        console.log(repoBranchName);
        const imageName = repoBranchName.toLowerCase();
        const containerName = `${imageName}_pr_${prNumber}`.toLowerCase();

        if (action === 'opened' || action === 'reopened' || action === 'synchronize') {
            try {
                const preDeployMessage = 'The PR is currently being deployed...';
                await addPRComment(repoName, prNumber, preDeployMessage);
                const postDeployMessage = await triggerDeployment(repoUrl, branchName, prNumber, imageName, containerName);
                await addPRComment(repoName, prNumber, postDeployMessage);
                console.log("Deployment completed and comment added!");
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error during deployment:', error);
            }
        } else if (action === 'closed') {
            try {
                const message = await removeDeployedContainer(containerName, imageName);
                await addPRComment(repoName, prNumber, message);
                console.log('Container removed and comment added');
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error during deployment:', error);
            }
        }
    }

    res.status(200).send('Event received');
});
```

import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import ngrok from 'ngrok';
```
- spawn: Used to run shell commands.
- fs: Provides file system operations.
- ngrok: Exposes local servers to the internet.

### Step 5. Environment Variables Set-up
```env

```
#### Section D: GitHub App Bot testing

* Navigate to the repository you want to make contributions and fork it.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Create a new branch,make changes,commit the changes and puush the   changes
* Create a Pull Request in the repository where the GitHub App is installed. The bot should automatically start the deployment process.

* Verify Deployment:

   * Check the PR thread for a comment from the bot with the deployment status and URL.
   * Access the deployment using the provided URL to verify that the container is running.

* Close the PR: Closing the PR should trigger the cleanup process, removing the Docker container and associated resources.
